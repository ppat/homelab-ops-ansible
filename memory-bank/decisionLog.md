# Decision Log

## 2/15/2025 - Initialize Memory Bank
- **Context:** A new project workspace was identified without an existing Memory Bank. A projectBrief.md file was found in the workspace root providing an overview of the project.
- **Decision:** Initialize a new Memory Bank for the project to support architectural guidance and documentation. 
- **Rationale:** Establishing a Memory Bank early will enable capturing key context, decisions, and progress as the project evolves. The projectBrief.md contents provide a foundation to summarize the product context and bootstrap the Memory Bank.
- **Implementation:**
  1. Create a memory-bank/ directory in the workspace root
  2. Add core Memory Bank files:
     - productContext.md summarizing the project overview, goals, principles, and structure
     - activeContext.md documenting the Memory Bank initialization process
     - progress.md tracking the initialization and outlining next steps
     - decisionLog.md capturing the decision and rationale to initialize the Memory Bank
  3. Confirm initialization with the user and check if other files are needed
  4. Read all created Memory Bank files to load the full available context

## 2/16/2025 - Create Architecture Overview
- **Context:** After initializing the Memory Bank, we needed a high-level overview of the repository's architecture to guide further analysis and recommendations.
- **Decision:** Create an architectureOverview.md file to visually and textually summarize the key components, organization, dependencies, and alignment with project goals.
- **Rationale:** Providing a clear architectural overview will facilitate shared understanding, enable more targeted analysis, and serve as a useful reference point for the team. Visualizations help convey the structure and relationships between components.
- **Implementation:**
  1. Gather information on Ansible collections, roles, and their organization from the repository structure and projectBrief.md
  2. Create diagrams using Mermaid to show role dependencies within collections and CI/CD workflows
  3. Document the purpose and functionality of each collection and role
  4. Explain how roles use input parameters and align with the project's goals and principles
  5. Summarize external dependencies for using and developing the collections and roles
  6. Save the architectureOverview.md file in the memory-bank/ directory
  7. Request review and feedback from the user to refine the document

## 2/16/2025 - Refine Architecture Overview Based on Feedback
- **Context:** The user reviewed the initial architecture overview and provided detailed feedback and corrections to better align the document with the project's functional perspectives and intents.
- **Decision:** Update the architectureOverview.md file to address the user's feedback and more accurately capture the purposes, relationships, and use cases of the Ansible collections.
- **Rationale:** Incorporating the user's insights will result in a more precise and meaningful architectural overview that reflects the true nature and goals of the project. The refined document will serve as a better reference and guide for further analysis and decision-making.
- **Implementation:**
  1. Clarify the primary use case of the `archive` collection for imaging disks from pre-built OS images
  2. Revise the explanation of the `block_device` collection to focus on its role in partitioning and creating file systems on block devices
  3. Specify that the `configure` collection is used for configuring common system services like `systemd` and `cloud-init`
  4. Expand on the purpose and scope of the `os` collection in applying pre-determined requirements to a base Ubuntu image, detailing specific requirements like package management, kernel configuration, and initramfs building
  5. Explain the relationship between the `os` collection and the Packer image build process, highlighting the integration through an Ansible playbook in a separate repository
  6. Investigate the GitHub Actions workflows and `galaxy.yml` files to identify and document functional and dependency relationships between collections
  7. Refine the overall architecture overview to better capture the functional perspectives, intents, and relationships of the collections
  8. Share the updated architectureOverview.md file with the user for another round of review and feedback

## 2/16/2025 - Finalize Architecture Overview
- **Context:** After incorporating the user's feedback and additional information, the updated architecture overview was presented for final review. The user confirmed that the revised document accurately captures the project's architecture, collection relationships, and provisioning workflow.
- **Decision:** Finalize the architectureOverview.md file and use it as the basis for planning the next steps in the project.
- **Rationale:** With the user's approval, the finalized architecture overview provides a comprehensive and accurate representation of the project's architecture. It will serve as a valuable reference and guide for further analysis, decision-making, and planning of the project's next steps.
- **Implementation:**
  1. Confirm with the user that the updated architecture overview meets their expectations and accurately represents the project's architecture
  2. Mark the architectureOverview.md file as finalized in the Memory Bank
