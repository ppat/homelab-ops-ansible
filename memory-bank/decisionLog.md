# Decision Log

## 2/15/2025 - Initialize Memory Bank
- **Decision:** Initialize a new Memory Bank for the project to support architectural guidance and documentation.
- **Rationale:** Establishing a Memory Bank early will enable capturing key context, decisions, and progress as the project evolves.

## 2/16/2025 - Create Architecture Overview
- **Decision:** Create an architectureOverview.md file to visually and textually summarize the key components, organization, dependencies, and alignment with project goals.
- **Rationale:** Providing a clear architectural overview will facilitate shared understanding, enable more targeted analysis, and serve as a useful reference point for the team.

## 2/16/2025 - Refine Architecture Overview Based on Feedback
- **Decision:** Update the architectureOverview.md file to address the user's feedback and more accurately capture the purposes, relationships, and use cases of the Ansible collections.
- **Rationale:** Incorporating the user's insights will result in a more precise and meaningful architectural overview that reflects the true nature and goals of the project.

## 2/16/2025 - Finalize Architecture Overview
- **Decision:** Finalize the architectureOverview.md file and use it as the basis for planning the next steps in the project.
- **Rationale:** With the user's approval, the finalized architecture overview provides a comprehensive and accurate representation of the project's architecture.

## 2/16/2025 - Begin Detailed Implementation Review
- **Decision:** Start the detailed implementation review by examining the repository structure, codebase organization, and each collection and role in depth.
- **Rationale:** A thorough analysis of the codebase will help identify opportunities for optimization, refactoring, and adherence to best practices.

## 2/16/2025 - Complete Detailed Implementation Review
- **Decision:** Document the findings, recommendations, and potential improvements for all collections and roles in the implementationReviewFindings.md file.
- **Rationale:** Thoroughly reviewing each collection and its roles helps identify areas for optimization, refactoring, and adherence to best practices. Documenting the findings ensures alignment with the project's architecture, goals, and principles.

## 2/16/2025 - Save Implementation Review Findings for Later Action
- **Decision:** Save the implementation review findings in the Memory Bank for future reference and action, as the next task or conversation will focus on a different aspect of the project.
- **Rationale:** Prioritizing the implementation review findings for later action allows the project to focus on other high-priority tasks while ensuring the findings are captured and available for future implementation.
