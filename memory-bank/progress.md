# Progress Tracking

## Memory Bank Initialization
- A new Memory Bank has been created for the project
- Core files (productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md) have been added with initial content
- The Memory Bank is ready to support the project going forward

## Architecture Overview
- Created architectureOverview.md to provide a high-level visual and textual overview of the repository's architecture
- Captured key elements including collection descriptions, role dependencies, input parameters, alignment with project goals, CI/CD workflows, and external dependencies
- Refined the architecture overview based on user feedback and finalized it as a comprehensive and accurate representation of the project's architecture

## Detailed Implementation Review
- Conducted a detailed implementation review to analyze the codebase, identify areas for improvement, and provide recommendations for optimization
- Covered the repository structure, codebase organization, and each collection and role in depth
- Focused on analyzing relationships and dependencies, examining role variables and defaults, reviewing task logic, assessing testing coverage, and investigating CI/CD workflows
- Documented the findings, recommendations, and potential improvements in the implementationReviewFindings.md file

## Implementation Review Findings
- Completed the detailed implementation review for all collections and roles
- Summarized key findings and recommendations in the implementationReviewFindings.md file, covering areas such as code structure, testing, CI/CD workflows, performance, security, and documentation
- Saved the implementation review findings in the Memory Bank for future reference and action, as the next task or conversation will focus on a different aspect of the project

## Next Steps
- Prioritize and plan the implementation of the recommendations and improvements identified during the implementation review
- Collaborate with the user to discuss the findings, gather feedback, and align on the next steps for the project
- Focus on other high-priority tasks or aspects of the project, as indicated by the user
- Continuously update the Memory Bank files to capture the project's progress, decisions, and rationale
- Refer to the finalized architectureOverview.md and implementationReviewFindings.md files as a guide and reference for future work on the project
