# Progress Tracking

## Current Focus Areas

These areas are derived from the detailed analysis in [Implementation Review Findings](implementationReviewFindings.md):

### Testing Enhancement

Reference: [Testing Coverage and Effectiveness](implementationReviewFindings.md#testing-coverage-and-effectiveness)

- Expand Molecule testing coverage:
  - Add edge case scenarios for `unpack` role
  - Include hardware configuration tests for `provision` role
  - Develop comprehensive configuration tests for `fstab` role
- Improve CI/CD workflow efficiency
- Implement automated test coverage reporting

### Code Optimization

Reference: [Code Structure and Organization](implementationReviewFindings.md#code-structure-and-organization)

- Consolidate similar functionality:
  - Merge `apt_install` and `apt_uninstall` roles
  - Combine `partition` and `filesystem` roles
  - Unify `kernel_cmdline` and `kernel_config` roles
- Refactor complex logic in `install_k3s_service` role
- Remove code duplication in `sync` and `unpack` roles

### Security Hardening

Reference: [Security Hardening](implementationReviewFindings.md#security-hardening)

- Review and update security configurations
- Implement secure configuration management
- Regular dependency updates and patching
- Enhance security documentation

## Next Steps

As outlined in [Implementation Review Findings](implementationReviewFindings.md#next-steps):

1. Prioritize implementation review findings
2. Create detailed implementation plan for role consolidation
3. Set up test coverage monitoring
4. Establish security review process
5. Update documentation as changes are implemented

## Success Metrics

Aligned with findings in [Areas for Optimization and Improvement](implementationReviewFindings.md#areas-for-optimization-and-improvement):

- Increased test coverage percentage
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved CI/CD pipeline performance
- Enhanced security posture
- Streamlined codebase maintenance
