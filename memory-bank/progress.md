# Progress Tracking

## Memory Bank Initialization
- A new Memory Bank has been created for the project
- Core files (productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md) have been added with initial content
- The Memory Bank is ready to support the project going forward

## Architecture Overview
- Created architectureOverview.md to provide a high-level visual and textual overview of the repository's architecture
- Captured key elements including:
  - Description of each Ansible collection and the common functionality of the roles within them
  - Diagram showing the organization and dependencies of roles within each collection
  - Overview of common input parameters patterns used by the roles
  - Explanation of how the collections and roles align with and support the project's goals and principles
  - Diagrams of the CI/CD workflows for Molecule testing and publishing releases
  - Summary of external dependencies for using and developing the collections and roles
- Requested review and feedback from the user to iterate on and refine the document
- Received detailed feedback and corrections from the user on the architecture overview

## Architecture Overview Refinement
- Updated the architectureOverview.md file to address user feedback and more accurately capture the project's architecture
- Key updates included:
  - Clarifying the primary use cases and purposes of the `archive`, `block_device`, `configure`, and `os` collections
  - Expanding on the `os` collection's role in applying pre-determined requirements to a base Ubuntu image
  - Explaining the relationship between the `os` collection and the Packer image build process
  - Investigating and documenting functional and dependency relationships between collections
  - Adding a "Provisioning Workflow" section outlining the step-by-step process of using the collections together

## Architecture Overview Finalization
- User reviewed the updated architecture overview and confirmed that it accurately captures the project's architecture, collection relationships, and provisioning workflow
- The architectureOverview.md file has been finalized and will serve as the basis for planning the next steps in the project

## Implementation Review
- Conducted an initial analysis of the repository structure and codebase organization
- Identified the following key points:
  - Collections are organized into separate directories at the root level, each containing roles, README, galaxy.yml, and testing scenarios
  - Roles within each collection follow a consistent structure (README, defaults, tasks, handlers, templates, files)
  - Molecule testing is used extensively, with multiple scenarios per role
  - The `k3s` collection includes additional orchestration and automation logic through playbooks and custom plugins
- Planned focus areas for the detailed implementation review:
  1. Analyzing relationships and dependencies between roles and collections
  2. Examining role variables and defaults for documentation, scoping, and best practices
  3. Reviewing task logic for performance, security, and optimization opportunities
  4. Assessing testing coverage and effectiveness of Molecule scenarios
  5. Investigating CI/CD workflows for proper configuration, efficiency, and fast feedback
- Completed the detailed review of the `archive`, `block_device`, and `configure` collections and their roles
  - Analyzed code structure, dependencies, and potential areas for improvement
  - Reviewed Molecule testing scenarios and assessed their coverage and effectiveness
  - Documented findings and recommendations in the Memory Bank

- Proceeding with the detailed review of the `raspberry_pi` collection and its roles
  - Analyzing code structure, dependencies, and potential areas for improvement
  - Reviewing Molecule testing scenarios and assessing their coverage and effectiveness
  - Documenting findings and recommendations in the Memory Bank
- Regularly collaborating with the user to discuss progress, share findings and recommendations, gather feedback, and align on next steps
- Implementing agreed-upon changes and optimizations based on the review findings
- Continuously updating the Memory Bank files to capture progress, decisions, and rationale behind the changes

## Next Steps
