# Active Context

## Current State

The project has completed its initial architecture review and documentation phase. Key documentation has been established and organized:

- Architecture Overview: Comprehensive technical documentation
- Product Context: Core project goals and implementation guidelines
- [Implementation Review Findings](implementationReviewFindings.md): Detailed improvement recommendations

## Active Initiatives

Based on findings in [Implementation Review Findings](implementationReviewFindings.md):

1. Code Optimization
   Reference: [Code Structure and Organization](implementationReviewFindings.md#code-structure-and-organization)
   - Role consolidation planning
   - Performance improvements
   - Code duplication removal

2. Testing Enhancement
   Reference: [Testing Coverage and Effectiveness](implementationReviewFindings.md#testing-coverage-and-effectiveness)
   - Expanding Molecule test coverage
   - Improving CI/CD workflow efficiency
   - Setting up test coverage monitoring

3. Security Hardening
   Reference: [Security Hardening](implementationReviewFindings.md#security-hardening)
   - Security configuration review
   - Dependency update process
   - Security documentation enhancement

## Immediate Focus

Prioritized from [Next Steps](implementationReviewFindings.md#next-steps):

- Prioritize implementation review findings
- Create detailed plan for role consolidation
- Begin test coverage expansion
- Establish security review process

## Open Questions

Derived from [Specific Findings and Recommendations](implementationReviewFindings.md#specific-findings-and-recommendations):

- Priority order for role consolidation
- Test coverage targets for each role
- Security review frequency and scope
- Documentation update strategy as changes are implemented
