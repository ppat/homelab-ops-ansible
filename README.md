# Homelab Ops Ansible Collections

![lint](https://github.com/ppat/homelab-ops-ansible/actions/workflows/lint.yaml/badge.svg)

A suite of Ansible collections designed for efficient infrastructure automation. These collections focus on immutable infrastructure patterns and are optimized for homelab environments while being robust enough for production use.

## Core Principles

- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Replace rather than patch - making your infrastructure more reliable
- **Performance-Focused**: Tasks run only when needed, optimized for speed without compromising security
- **Declarative Configuration**: Define desired states clearly and achieve them consistently
- **Practical Solutions**: Following best practices while staying pragmatic

## Key Features

- **Block Device Management**: Automated disk provisioning, partitioning, and filesystem setup
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Streamlined k3s cluster setup with Flux CD integration
- **System Configuration**: Comprehensive OS and service configuration management
- **Package Handling**: Flexible package management across different architectures
- **Raspberry Pi Support**: Specialized tools for Pi-based infrastructure

## Getting Started

Each collection is designed for specific infrastructure needs:

- **Setting up storage?** ‚Üí [block_device](block_device/) collection handles automated disk management
- **Deploying Kubernetes?** ‚Üí [k3s](k3s/) collection provides streamlined cluster setup
- **Configuring systems?** ‚Üí [configure](configure/) collection manages system settings
- **Managing packages?** ‚Üí [packages](packages/) collection handles software deployment
- **Working with Raspberry Pi?** ‚Üí [raspberry_pi](raspberry_pi/) collection offers Pi-specific tools

Visit each collection's documentation for detailed usage instructions and examples.

## Quality Assurance

- Comprehensive Molecule tests for each collection
- Continuous Integration via GitHub Actions
- Automated linting and syntax checking
- Detailed documentation requirements
